# Visual Identity
- **Modern & Clean**: ChatNova adopts a minimalist aesthetic, focusing on clarity, whitespace, and refined typography. The UI should feel like a premium AI interface—uncluttered and focused on the conversational content.
- **Native Visuals**: All dynamically generated components (charts, galleries) must share the same design language (color palette, spacing, shadows) as the core chat interface to ensure a unified user experience.

# Tone and Voice
- **Adaptive Professionalism**: The application’s tone is primarily professional, capable, and efficient. It should speak with technical precision but remain accessible.
- **Contextual Adaptation**: The voice should subtly shift based on user queries—remaining objective for data analysis while being helpful and instructional when users are configuring complex model settings.

# UX Principles
- **Performance First**: Responsiveness is the core of the ChatNova experience. Streaming must be low-latency, and UI generation must feel like a seamless part of the response flow.
- **Frictionless Configuration**: Managing complex settings like "Bring Your Own Key" (BYOK) or MCP server configurations should be integrated naturally into the user's path, never acting as a barrier to the primary chat task.

# Content Standards
- **Clarity over Brevity**: When explaining model behaviors, errors, or system states, prioritize completeness and clarity. Provide users with enough context to understand "why" something happened, especially regarding API interactions.
- **Distinction of Content**: Maintain a clear visual or structural distinction between system-level messaging (labels, errors) and AI-generated responses to ensure user trust and transparency.

# Generative UI Philosophy
- **Insight-Driven Triggers**: Visual components should only be generated when they add tangible value or clarity beyond what plain text can provide. Charts and tables are tools for insight, not just decoration.
- **Seamless Integration**: The transition from text to visual data must be fluid, maintaining the conversational context without jarring the user’s focus.
